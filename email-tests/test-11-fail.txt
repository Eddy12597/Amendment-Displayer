Delegate: Mexico
We wish to propose an amendment to the Brazilian resolution on education.

We believe the section about funding needs to be stronger. Instead of "seeks additional resources," it should say "allocates a minimum of 4% of national education budgets."

The current language is too vague.

Amendment Type: AMEND
