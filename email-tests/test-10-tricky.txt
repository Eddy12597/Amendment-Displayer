Dear Secretariat,

As the delegate representing the Russian Federation, I wish to propose a modification to the resolution currently under consideration. The draft, primarily sponsored by the delegation of India, addressing "Cybersecurity Norms in International Relations," contains problematic language in section 2, subsection d.

The existing provision at 2.d states something to the effect of establishing mandatory reporting requirements for all state-sponsored cyber incidents. We believe this creates an undue burden and infringes upon national sovereignty. Instead, we propose that the text be changed to reflect voluntary reporting mechanisms, with protections for classified intelligence sources. The new phrasing should read: "Encourages voluntary disclosure of significant cyber incidents through established diplomatic channels, while respecting national security prerogatives."

Our rationale is straightforward: mandatory regimes are unworkable in the sensitive domain of cybersecurity.

Regards,
Delegate of Russia
