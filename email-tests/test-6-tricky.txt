Hey, Japan here. Need to tweak the US's reso on Space Debris.

AMEND 4.b.
Currently says: "Requests the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) to develop guidelines."
Change it to: "Mandates COPUOS to develop binding guidelines for debris mitigation and satellite end-of-life procedures."

Why? Requesting is too weak. This is urgent.
Also, USA = main sub. Thx.
