Proposed edit to the UK-led draft about maritime security.

The part about joint patrols in clause 6 is good, but needs strengthening. Specifically, 6.a.iii, which currently suggests information sharing "where appropriate." This loophole renders the provision toothless.

Replace "where appropriate" with "through established mechanisms biannually, with exceptions requiring Security Council approval."

This ensures consistent implementation.
