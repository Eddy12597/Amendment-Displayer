Australia responding:

We propose to AMEND the above (Clause 4.b.i of the Canada resolution).

New text should be: "Mandates the use of satellite tracking for critically endangered migratory species, and encourages its use for all endangered migratory species."

Reason: For critically endangered populations, tracking should not be optional if we are serious about conservation.
