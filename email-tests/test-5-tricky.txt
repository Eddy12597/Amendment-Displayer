2. AMEND Clause 3.a.ii.
   From: "Limits exploratory drilling in ecologically sensitive zones"
   To: "Establishes a multilateral scientific review panel prior to approving exploratory drilling in zones designated as ecologically sensitive by the Arctic Council"
   Reason: Adds necessary oversight.

3. ADD new sub-clause under 5.c:
